Welcome to Minesweeper!!
This is the classic game with a 9 by 9 board and ten mines.
Click on a block to uncover it.
If there is a mine under there, you lose the game. 
If you pick a block with a number on it, the number tells you how 
many mines exist in its direct neighbours. 
Click on the flag button to let you mark which blocks you think are a mine.
You are only allowed to select 10 blocks as mines, there is counter keeping track.
If you change your mind, while having clicked the flag button still on, click on the flag 
again and it should disappear.
Click on the flag button to go back to being able to select blocks.
After the game ends, press restart to try again. 

Have fun!!!
